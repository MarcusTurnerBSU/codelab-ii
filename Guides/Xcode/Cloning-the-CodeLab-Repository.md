## Step 1

So far we have successfully created your repository on GitHub, but we need to download this to your machine so you can write your code and then send this back to GitHub. For this we will use GitHub desktop.

Open GitHub desktop and clone the repository. If you have no existing repositories you can do this by clicking the ```Clone a Repository``` button on the opening screen. If you already have some repositories downloaded you can add another on by selecting ```File --> Clone Repository``` from the menu bar.

## Step 2

You will be presented with *Clone a Repository*  screen similar to the one below. You should look for the repository you wish to clone from those listed. This will be named something like: CodeLab-II-20-21/codelab-ii-yourgithubusername

Click ```Choose...```next to the local path field and browse to sensible location on your machine to save the repository, eg: ```Documents → Dev```.

Once you have selected a folder on your machine click ```Clone``` to download the repository.

## Step 3

You should now have a copy of the repository from Github on your local machine and GitHub desktop should look like the below screen. You are now ready to add code to your repository and undertake the coding challenges. The remaining steps in this guide demo how to create a project in the repository.

</p>

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Step 6

Set the options for your project:
* Give the product a name (e.g. "HelloWorld")
* Set organisation identifiers (e.g. com.yourname)
* Set language as C++
* Click ```Next```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Step 7

Save your work in the relevant chapter exercises folder in your repository.

</p>

*If you are taking option 2 of the Programming Skills Portfolio Assessment you should create a new folder in the root of the repository for the exercises and name these appropriately (e.g. "Football Draw")*

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Step 8

You will be presented with the project build settings.

<p align="center">

</p>

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Step 9

Click ```main.cpp``` in the left hand toolbar. This will open the main code file, which should include a pre-built Hello World application.

</p>


## Step 10

To run the program simply click the build & run icon in the top left :arrow_forward:

Now you are all set to modify the code and create your desired application

## Step 11

Once you have completed your program you can commit the solution to your repository and push it back to GitHub. Github Desktop will keep track of your changes in your main.cpp file and any other files you add to your project. You should regularly make commits to ensure you can fall back to previous versions if things go wrong. You should also push your commits back up to your Github repository often, this will make sure you have a backup of your work.

In GitHub desktop write a commit message for the changes made (e.g. *Completed Hello World Program*) and click ```commit to master```

&nbsp;

## Step 12

Once you have commited the changes you need to push them back to GitHub to keep your local and remote repositories in sync. To do so click ```Push Origin```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Step 13

Your code should now also be backed up on GitHub. If you want to check or need to view your repository on GitHub you can do so at anytime by clicking the ```View on GitHub``` button in GitHub desktop.
